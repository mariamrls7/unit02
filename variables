1.Declare a constant of type Int called myAge and set it to your age.

fun main() {
  val myage = 33 // Int
  println(myage)
  
  }
//--------------------------------------------------
2.Declare a variable of type Double called averageAge. Initially, set it to your own age. Then, set it to the average of your age and my own age of 30.

fun main() {
  val myage = 33 // Int
  val age = 30 // Int
  
  var averageage = 31.5 // A Double
  
  println(myage)
  println(age)
  println(averageage)
  
  }

  //-----------------------------------------------
  3.Create a constant called testNumber and initialize it with whatever integer you’d like. Next, create another constant called evenOdd and set it equal to testNumber modulo 
  Now change testNumber to various numbers. What do you notice about evenOdd?







  
Create a variable called answer and initialize it with the value 0. Increment it by 1. Add 10 to it. Multiply it by 10. Then, shift it to the right by 3. After all of these operations, what’s the answer?
